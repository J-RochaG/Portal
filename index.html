        <p>Hello, my name is Jose Rocha, and I am currently enrolled in the Application Development track at Year Up. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball in a Sunday league and going to the gym to work out. I am very passionate about basketball and can talk about it for hours. I also enjoy playing video games and I consider myself to be quite skilled at them. Before pursuing my education, I worked in maintenance and was promoted to Assistant Maintenance Supervisor. In this role, I gained a lot of experience repairing household appliances, including washers and water heaters. If you ever need any help with this type of repair work, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
        <p>My primary goal is to become a back-end developer and enhance my coding skills. I have a strong passion for technology and software development, which has motivated me to pursue a career in this field. I am dedicated to gaining the necessary skills and experience to succeed in this role and to make significant contributions to the organization I work for.</p>
